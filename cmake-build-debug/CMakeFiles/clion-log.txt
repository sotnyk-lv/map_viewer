CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:18 (find_package):
  By not providing "Find-lcurl.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "-lcurl", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "-lcurl" with any
  of the following names:

    -lcurlConfig.cmake
    -lcurl-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "-lcurl" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "-lcurl_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "-lcurl"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
